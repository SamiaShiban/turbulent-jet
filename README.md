A  two-dimensional model to study the sediment deposition from marine
outfall jets. The introduced unidirectional coupling (fluid–sediment) is an appropriate choice in
the case of low-concentrated particle-laden jets such as municipal wastewater discharge, where
the concentration of particles is small enough and does not affect the hydrodynamic
development of the jet in the nearfield. The sedimentation model takes advantage of the
preferential concentration phenomenon. The deposition criterion states that the deposition of
sediments begins when the vertical component of the entrainment velocity becomes smaller
than the settling velocity. Once the deposition process begins, it is controlled by the settling
velocity, entrainment velocity, volume flux, and sediment concentration. The deposition along
the jet trajectory is expressed by an ordinary differential equation coupled with the liquid
phase equations. Experiments of Lane-Serff and Moran [Sedimentation from Buoyant jets. J Hyd
Eng. 2005;131(3):166–174], Cuthbertson and Davies [Deposition from particle-laden, round,
turbulent, horizontal, buoyant jets in stationary and coflowing receiving fluids. J Hydr Eng.
2008;134(4):390–402], and Lee [Mixing of horizontal sediment laden jets [dissertation]. Hong
Kong: University of Hong Kong; 2010], chosen from bibliography, are used to validate the
model. These experiments cover the cases of horizontal and inclined buoyant jets in stationary
ambient, horizontal buoyant jets in co-flow current and nonbuoyant horizontal jets in
stationary ambient. Good agreement between the experiments and the obtained simulations is
revealed.
